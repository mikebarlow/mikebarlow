## Hey hey hey 👋

PHP developer of 17 years based in Sheffield, UK. PHP developer of 20 years if you count the Grand Theft Auto fan sites I was building while I was meant to be doing school work! 

Currently building things for the Radio and Audio industry with [Aiir](https://aiir.com). 📻

### Side Projects

As a lot of developers do, I dabble with some side projects!

* Server and Website Management tools with [ServerAuth](https://serverauth.com). 🛠️
* Building static sites from markdown with [Hosted.md](https://hosted.md). ☁️
* Converting html to pdfs with [GeneratePDFs.com](https://generatepdfs.com). 📈 

### Open source

These were scratching my own itch but I also have a couple of open source packages.

* Expressive response helpers for Laravel based APIs - [mbarlow/laravel-response-helpers](https://github.com/mikebarlow/laravel-response-helpers) 👌
* Livewire Bell Icon UI for Laravel based user notifications - [mbarlow/megaphone](https://github.com/mikebarlow/megaphone) / [Demo](https://megaphone.mikebarlow.co.uk) 📣
